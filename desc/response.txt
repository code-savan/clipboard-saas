Hello Chrome Web Store Review Team,

Thank you for your feedback on our Instant ClipBoard extension. We have addressed the permission issue mentioned in the rejection notice.

Changes made:
- Removed the "scripting" permission from the manifest.json file
- Confirmed that this permission was not being actively used by the extension
- No functionality has been impacted by this change

We now only request the permissions necessary for our extension's current features. The updated package has been submitted for your review.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. We look forward to having our extension approved and available in the Chrome Web Store.

Best regards,
Instant ClipBoard Team
